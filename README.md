# tic-tac-toe-Ai

Implementation Details
The game uses IPython widgets for creating buttons representing each cell on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
Players take turns clicking on the cells to make their moves.
The game checks for a winner after each move and announces the result.
In the case of a tie, the game declares it accordingly.
AI Opponent
The game also features a simple AI opponent that makes random moves. The current implementation is basic, but you can explore more advanced AI strategies like the minimax algorithm for a more challenging opponent.

Code Structure
on_button_click: Handles player moves and checks for a winner after each move.
switch_player: Switches between 'X' and 'O' players.
check_winner: Checks for a winning condition or a tie.
reset_board: Resets the board for a new game.
ai_make_move: Implements the AI opponent's move (current implementation is a random move).
Customization and Contributions
Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different features, and contribute to the project! You can enhance the AI logic, improve the user interface, or add additional functionalities to make the game even more engaging.

Happy gaming!
